Hey Mino guys ! :D

Here's my take on the Snek game. It took me one night to make in Unity, so I would say 4-5 hours.

You can find the exe under the Build folder, and the code under Assets/Scripts.
The game will start after a brief delay, the code is setup in a way that we can have more snakes and more food, but I chose to put 2 of each for the heck of it.

When a player wins, the game restarts automatically.

CONTROLS : 
Arrows for the red snek.
WASD for the blue snek.
Escape to quit.

Enjoy ! :P
